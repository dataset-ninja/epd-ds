**EPD: Electric Pylon Detection Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the geospatial domain, and in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 1500 images with 3231 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pylon*).

Images in the EPD dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *EPD-S* (1450 images) and *EPD-C* (50 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Beihang University, China</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Ministry of Education, China</span>.
