**EPD: Electric Pylon Detection Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the geospatial domain, and in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 720 images with 1479 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pylon*).

Images in the EPD dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (360 images), *train* (180 images), and *val* (180 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 datasets: ***epd s*** (700 images) and ***epd c*** (20 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Beihang University, China</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Ministry of Education, China</span>.
